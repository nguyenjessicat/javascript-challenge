# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

I was hired by “Aliens-R-Real” organization to go through their dataset and produce a searchable table for their users to find alien sightings.

I was allowed to use only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted, according to the client.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Create a basic HTML web page 
* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Minimum columns: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`

* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

I have completed Level 1.  Level 2 is coming.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
